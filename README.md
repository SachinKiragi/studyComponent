# GroupStudy Platform - Real-Time Study Collaboration  

## Project Overview  
GroupStudy Platform is a **real-time video conferencing application** designed for **seamless collaborative learning**. Unlike traditional platforms, it allows users to **instantly join study groups by simply typing a subject name**, eliminating the need for invite links. Users can **create rooms, join ongoing study sessions, and interact through video calls and chat messaging**, making group study more accessible and engaging.  

## Problem Statement  
In today’s digital learning environment, students face **limited interactive learning opportunities** and often feel **isolated in virtual classrooms**. Existing platforms lack **seamless study-based group collaboration**, relying on **manual invite links** and **complex setups** that hinder accessibility. **GroupStudy Platform** solves this by offering an intuitive, **subject-based joining system**, where students can **search, join, or create study rooms effortlessly**, fostering a more **engaging and interactive learning experience**.  

## Key Features  
**User Authentication** – Secure signup and login  
**Instant Room Joining** – Type a subject name to join without invite links  
**Real-time Video Conferencing** – Connect with multiple students via WebRTC  
**Chat Messaging** – Text-based communication alongside video calls  
**User Presence Indicators** – See who joins or leaves the study group  
**Persistent Chat History** – Messages remain for session duration  
**AI-Powered Doubt Resolution (Gemini AI)** – Get instant answers to academic doubts in real-time

- **Frontend**: React.js application with Socket.io client for real-time communication  
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express server, Socket.io for WebSocket connections  
- **Database**: MongoDB for user and study room storage  
- **Real-time Communication**: WebRTC (via simple-peer) for peer-to-peer video streaming  

## Future Plans  

- Enable real-time collaborative coding with syntax guidance  
- Implement screen sharing functionality  
- Add recording capabilities for study sessions  
- Develop mobile applications for iOS and Android  
- Implement user profiles with customizable settings  
- Add virtual background options

## Troubleshooting  

If you encounter SSL certificate issues during development:  
1. For development purposes, the application can run on HTTP instead of HTTPS  
2. If using HTTPS, you may need to accept self-signed certificates in your browser  
3. For API requests, the application includes options to bypass SSL certificate validation in development mode
